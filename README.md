# Face Detection App using OpenCV
This project is a real-time face detection application built with C++ using the OpenCV library. It uses the webcam feed to detect faces in real-time and highlights them with red rectangles.

# Features
-Real-time face detection using Haar cascades.
-Highlights detected faces with red rectangles.
-Flips the video feed horizontally for a natural mirror view.
-Processes video at a resolution of 640x480 pixels.

# Hardware
A system with a functioning webcam.

#Software
OpenCV (version 4.x or higher recommended)
C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC)
Supported operating system: Windows/Linux/MacOS.

# Conclusion
In my learning journey of programming in C++, I have created a simple face detection app. This project helped me understand how to use OpenCV libraries, work with real-time video processing, and implement face detection using Haar cascades. Itâ€™s a small but significant step in exploring the capabilities of computer vision.
